                                       HEART DISEASE PREDICTION
created a machine learning model to predict HEART DISEASE Pusing KNN model.This project aims to develop a model that predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on various features using  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).The dataset used is publicly available and consists of patient data, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and more.
